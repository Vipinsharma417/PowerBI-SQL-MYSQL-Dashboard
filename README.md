# ðŸ“Š End-to-End Power BI Dashboard Project (SQL Server + MySQL)

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

I built this dashboard to simulate a real-world business scenario where:

- Two teams work on different parts of the data.
- The company transitions from **SQL Server** to **MySQL**.
- Dashboards must remain **unchanged**, while data and sources may change.

The goal: Create a **flexible and scalable BI solution** that updates visuals and KPIs automatically with new data, regardless of the underlying database.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions)
- **Power Query Advanced Editor**
- **SQL Server** (Test & Production environments)
- **MySQL Workbench + MySQL Server**
- **SQL Joins and Data Cleaning**
- **MySQL Connector for Power BI**

---

## ðŸ”§ Features & Capabilities

- Connected to both **SQL Server** and **MySQL** databases
- Created complex DAX Measures and KPI indicators
- Designed dashboards that **auto-update when new data is inserted**
- Used **Power Query Advanced Editor** to smoothly switch between environments
- Successfully transitioned same dashboard across databases â€” with **no change to visuals or DAX**

## ðŸ§  Real-World Scenario Simulated

> Suppose two teams in a company work on the same dashboard.  
> Team A creates the report, Team B updates the data a week later.  
> A manager asks to reflect the new data â€” **without rebuilding anything**.  
>  
> âœ… This dashboard handles that seamlessly. Just change the data â€” the dashboard updates itself!
